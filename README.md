## Installation

You need to have a running [Anisette](https://github.com/Dadoum/anisette-v3-server) and a decrypted plist file of your tracker. The latter can be challenging to obtain, see [this issue](https://github.com/malmeloo/FindMy.py/issues/31)).

With those two things ready, setup should be easy using the config flow.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to [FindMy.py](https://github.com/malmeloo/FindMy.py/), on which this integration is based on.
